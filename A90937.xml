            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈1+ pages missing〉</desc>
               </gap>when we delivered our last Petiton against tyeth, which did expresse the unjustnesse of paying it, and that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reliefe from the House of Commons of <hi>England:</hi> they then commanded their Speaker to tell us we were mistaken, his meaning we did not then well understand. But now this explanation Ordinance doth declare the meaning of that House, that we were mistaken if wee did expect any helpe from them, for any such burthen as lay upon us: but especially such as they themselves had gaine by, as in impropriations, indeed this doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us and the whole world, that this House of Commons intend to deliver us from all our oppressions as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did the <hi>Israelites,</hi> from thence he told them his little finger should weigh down his Fathers Loynes in oppression, but by it he lost ten Tribes to his servant let our Parliament take heed now for <hi>England</hi> is moved with oppression, and such answers to Petitions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A second reason why we should take more notice of this then other Ordinances of this nature formerly past, as worthy of thankes and praise, is because it was as we conceive in opposition to <hi>Sir Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and the Armies Propositions, of which this was one, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Tyeth: We cannot but be sensible of this, for we petitioned Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the rest at St <hi>Albans,</hi> to doe their utmost for the bringing of us out of our worse then <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, we looking upon him as one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and fitted of God for that purpose, as <hi>Moses</hi> was one who rather chooses to suffer with the people of God, then to be poysonned with a selfe-seeking Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments honour: or a Silver Charger fild with (not only) the head of innocent <hi>John Baptist,</hi> but also the heads of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160448:2"/>all the harmelesse ones in the Kingdome, but should have been covered over with Gold, by a company of treacherous Aldermen and their Abettors, but blessed be that God who let him see what was in the bottome before ever the Gold did dazle his eyes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third reason of our returning thankes, is because this Ordinance is to be fiered by two Iustices of the peace: and the greatest part of our Commissioners in that kind are such as have been against the Parliament in all these times of trouble, or else such selfe-seeking men as we are fully perswaded, will never doe any action that shall tend to the publique good, much lesse to any private or particular man, as we by wofull experience can speake in all causes, that have ever yet come before any of them, for the greatest favour that they use to shew is to let the Plaintiffe produce what conscionlesse witnes he will to swear for himselfe: and then to passe a censure of treble dammage, according to the oaths made against the poore Defendant, and to give out their warrant to seize upon any of his goods, and fell them as the Plaintiffe will, and the Parliament have left no way of reliefe for the poor Defendant but the Court of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equity, which is a remedy worse then the disease.</p>
            <p>And some of our wise and honest Iust-asses who are glad to take any occasion to whip those who have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully served their Country in these times of trouble, have against some given above foure times the value of what their very enemies had sworne their tyeth was worth.</p>
            <p>Now the premises considered, let all rationall men judge, if we have not cause to return thanks when we see
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160448:3"/>such glorious Ordinances guilded over with pretence of Gospel maintenance, for Ministers come forth especially (at this time) when our expectations were altogether for deliverance from such yoakes and burthens, now we did suppose our Parliament men would have done som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to gaine their Countries love againe, for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most past recovery, but we see now they are out of hope (if this Parliament be dissolved) ever to be chose any more, and therefore they intend to pay us home now: and if God prevent not to plunge us so deep in Bondage, that two or three Bienniall Parliaments will scarcely be able to bring us out againe.</p>
            <p>And if any shall object and say, I but there are some in the House of Commons that doe stand for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good and are willing to free us from our oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but that they are over powred by others that are enemies to common freedome.</p>
            <p>We answer, if we knew who they were we should be very sorry to accuse any such that stand for our good in the least, for we confesse we had more need incourage such that they might grow more bold and couragious and if there be some that are against opressive votes and ordinances we would be glad they had courage enough to declare to the Kingdome who are their enemies that they might be cheated no more with such men.</p>
            <p>But truly it doth not appeare to us who are our friends, for our proverb is <hi>silence gives consent</hi> &amp; non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they have a desire to ease us but are not able: for if they did we would help them as much as possible we could for by the Parliaments Declaration wee are to oppose oppression in whom so ever we find it, and so we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160448:3"/>are now resolved to do whatsoever it cost us, for as God hath made Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and the rest of that gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Army a meanes to preserve this perishing Kingdom, so he hath indued his Excellency, and the rest of his faithfull Commanders and private Soldiers with gallant resolutions to recover long lost freedomes, and in this with them we resolve to stand till death.</p>
            <p>Therefore now wee shall for this time conclude with these desires.</p>
            <p>First, that the dissembly of
<note n="*" place="margin">For to cal them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, is blasphemy.</note> devisers of oppressions for the Kingdome be desired to set a day apart, for thankes to be returned to those Gentlemen that made and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this gallant Ordinance to shoot through al the corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields in the Kingdom at once, &amp; that worthy Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> be desired to preach, because he is an able conscientious man for his ability he hath 120 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> at Clemons without temple bar, he hath also at <hi>Wooton</hi> in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try 260 l. <hi>per annum</hi> &amp; he is also Master of <hi>Pembrook</hi> hal at Cambridge which is thought to be worth nigh 200 l. <hi>per annum</hi> besids he hath four shillings <hi>per diem</hi> for siting to devise how to keepe the people in ignorance and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and his parish in <hi>Warwicke sheire</hi> whereof he was wont to write himselfe Minister before hee had got all these; now judge if he be not an able man, and that he is as conscionable as those by whom he hath his meanes and honours, judge ye, for he neaver comes to <hi>Wotton</hi> where he hath his 260 l. <hi>per annum</hi> but a matter of twise in a yeare, and that is out of conscience to receive his rith of the people for his great paines, but he doth supply the place very wel, for there is one that hath been outed by Parliament three severall times for his basenesse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160448:4"/>we thinke this man fit to preach first at this thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: in the afternoone we desire Mr. Hardwick of <hi>Hadam</hi> in our Country, bee desired to preach at this thanksgiving for he is a man whom the Parliament have given a living of 320 l. <hi>per annum</hi> and is a man of sound doctrine for his Parish had a charge of blasphemy and lyes against him, enough to out 20 better Members then he if ther had been any Iustice to be had, but he is a good Common wealths man for if there happen a Fast day to fall in Harvest he can dispence with that when he hath tith abroad, and tell his parish, tis most fit for great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Townes to fast that have but litle Corne to get in and therefore we think him a very fit man for this purpose, that so the Proverb may bee fullfilled like Priest like hearers.</p>
            <p>We also desire our neighbours in <hi>Essex</hi> to do as much as wee have done in order to this thanks, and wee think it wil be very fit for them to desire <hi>Obediah Seighwick</hi> there belowing bull calfe to bleat out thankes for them. We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so desire all other countyes to doe the like that so those that did make this ordinance may therby be encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make such an other as soone as may be in order to common freedome.</p>
